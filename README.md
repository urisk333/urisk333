Hi! <br>
I am a Software Engineer from Split, currently based in Zagreb. Specialised in JavaScript, TypeScript and React. Additionally, having a great understanding of the backend development. Never hesitate to learn new technologies. Always motivated to improve my software development skills.

Who wouldn't like all these nice technologies: <br>

The next ones on the menu:
- [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)

Currently working on my project [Vinco](https://github.com/urisk333/vinco) - planning to add more features and refactor into Typescript.

In the free time, my other passions are music (drumming), outdoor activities (sports climbing, snowboarding, cycling, running), nature, yoga.
